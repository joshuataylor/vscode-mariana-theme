## NOTE REGARDING SOURCE REPOSITORY!

This is a copy of the extension [Mariana by Ryan](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanolsonx.mariana-by-ryan), not sure what happened to the [source repo](https://github.com/ryanolsonx/vscode-mariana-theme), but this is great..

I have made the commits as mine, but they are not mine, they are from [@ryanolsonx](https://github.com/ryanolsonx), I'll remove this repo once his is public.
